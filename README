I made some changes to flixel when I was making Condition (http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/529101) and thought it would be nice to share them with the community.

It isn't the greatest code... but it may be helpful!

Features:

* 1. A new class: FlxDialog. It's basically just a different pause screen that you can send messages to through FlxG.showDialog().
* 2. Another new class: FlxTilingSprite. It's a sprite with a hacked rendering loop that will draw itself only on the screen and repeat. You can set it to vertical, horizontal, or both.
* 3. Some minor tweaks: 
	1. FlxPoint can be either an FlxObject or two (x,y) numbers. 
	2. FlxState now has an easy-to-use built in HUD reference that will always be drawn on top. You can put whatever FlxObject you want in there! Especially useful for FlxGroups 
	3. FlxState now has an addAt and an addBehind method. They add objects at a specific point on the stage (so you don't have to fiddle with FlxGroup layers)
